      <p><strong>Biography:</strong><br />
        Dr. WANG started to learn Bioinformatics in 2005 and received his B.Sc. and M.Sc. at Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University. He earned his Ph.D. in Bioinformatics and Genetics from The University of Hong Kong in 2016. His research focuses on large-scale Omics data analysis, particularly in autoimmune diseases. During his postdoctoral training, he contributed to major international collaborations that identified over 130 genetic loci associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). His integrative analyses combining public functional genomic data helped uncover cell-type specific gene regulation, providing key insights into disease pathogenesis. To date, he has published 32 peer-reviewed papers in journals including <em>Nature Genetics</em>, <em>Nature Communications</em>, <em>Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases</em>, and <em>Arthritis & Rheumatology</em>. In 2022, he joined the School of Life and Health Science & Faculty of Medicine at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen) as an assistant professor. His current focus is translating real-world big data into clinical applications, with the goal of advancing drug discovery and improving the accuracy of genetic screening.
